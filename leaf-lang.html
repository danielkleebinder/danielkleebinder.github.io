        <h1>What is Leaf?</h1>
        <p>
            The Leaf programming language is a statically and strongly typed, lexically scoped and interpreted
            programming language using type inference that allows the developer to implement traits and custom types. It
            is object oriented, but does not support inheritance because typically, it is a common source of
            maintainability issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            This programming language was solely written by me for educational purposes only. It should showcase some
            concepts I learned in my Masters computer science courses at TU Vienna. Although I am sure it could
            technically be used as production ready language, I would not recommend it yet.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Leaf by Example</h1>
        <p>
            This section shows you how to code using the leaf programming language.
        </p>

        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>
            First off, let's start with the most common code example in the history of programming; the "hello world"
            program. Leaf exports certain functions by default from it's core. One of these is the <code>println</code>
            function that takes zero to any number of parameters.
        </p>
        <pre>println("Hello World")</pre>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
            Variables can be used like in any other programming language. Leaf, especially, distinguishes between
            <code>const</code> and <code>var</code>. Constants cannot be modified after setting a value for the first
            time, variables, on the other hand, can. Since Leaf is a statically typed programming language, each
            declaration of a new variables requires either an initialization or a type specification.
        </p>
        <pre>
const a                   // invalid
const b: string           // invalid
const c = 10              // valid
var d: string = "Hello"   // valid
var e: number = true      // invalid</pre>
        <p>
            (be careful to always match the declared type with the type of the r-value, otherwise, the static semantic
            analyzer will error)
        </p>

        <h2>If Expression</h2>
        <p>
            Leaf knows different kinds of control structures. One of these is the <code>if</code> conditional
            expression. The interpreter will execute different branches based on a given predicate. The value of the
            last expression in the <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> branch will be returned an can be used in any
            other kind of expression or statement.
        </p>
        <pre>
const a = if false {
  "This is impossible"
} else {
  "This is the else branch"
}</pre>

        <h2>Loop Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Another very useful control structure is the <code>loop</code>. It is used to run a single code block
            multiple times. Compared to other programming languages, Leaf only knows this one kind of loop. A loop head
            consists of three blocks. The init block that is run before the first loop iteration, the condition and the
            step block that are both executed after each iteration.
        </p>
        <pre>
loop var i = 0 : i < 10 : i = i + 1 {
  println("This is iteration " + i)
}</pre>
        <p>
            But loop can also be executed with only a condition block or without any block at all in the head. In the
            latter case, the loop will run endlessly and has to be broken with <code>break</code> for example.
        </p>
        <pre>
loop isHungry() { eat() }
loop { break }</pre>
